## Summary

Maybe the biggest challenge I had facing this project was navigating the
verbose and often confusing Wikipedia API instructions. There is a lot
of data to unpack within Wikipedia and the API reflects that. Finally, I
figured out the correct query string to use that would give me the desired information
but it was a difficult process getting to that point.

Other difficulties I faced along the way were figuring out how to scaffold my application
with React. This was my first major solo project using React and although I understood React
in theory, applying that knowledge at the beginning was difficult.
