## Challenges

Maybe the biggest challenge I had facing this project was navigating the
        verbose and often confusing wikipedia API instructions. There is a lot
        of data to unpack within wikipedia and the API reflects that. Finally, I
        figured out the correct query string to use that would give me the desired information
        but it was a difficult process getting to that point.

Other difficulties I faced along the way were figuring out how to scaffold my application
        with React. This was my first major solo project using React and although I understood React
        in theory, applying that knowledge at the beginning was difficult.
